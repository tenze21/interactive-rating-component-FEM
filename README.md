## Overview
I have designed an interactive rating component where end viewers can rate on a product or service. It also has a thankyou state when the rating is submitted as required by the challenge. As a bonus I have also included a feature to show an error message when the user tries to submit the form without giving a rating.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process
I thoroughly went through the design and requirements for this challenge and planned out my steps. setting up the design with HTML and CSS was simple but I had a tough time setting up the functionality with` Javascript` guess I am losing touch with `Javascript`.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development
After doing this project I realize that I really needed to refresh my `Javascript` knowledge.
